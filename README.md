# Functional Programming Notes

This is my lifelong notes and dump for research findings
for everything about functional programming.
The chapters are not really chapters, they behave like categories
and is sorted based on knowledge dependency.

Topics that I hope will be covered.

* Language Revision (Haskell)
* Type Classes
* Concurrency and Parallelism
* Functional Reactive Programming
* Language Processing
